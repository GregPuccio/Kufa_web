        <p>Fencing is a beautiful sport based on skill, balance, intelligence, honor, and discipline.  The lessons that fencing teaches are directly applicable to life, business, relationships, and success in any challenge one may face.</p>
        <p>Just as fencing can instruct youth to lead more purposeful and successful lives, many of the qualities that make a truly great fencer are learned outside of the gym - from family, from triumph, and especially from failures.</p>
        <p>Fencing - with its endless cycles of victories and defeats in training and competition - teaches children and young adults two qualities often missing in todayâ€™s environment: patience and perseverance.</p>
