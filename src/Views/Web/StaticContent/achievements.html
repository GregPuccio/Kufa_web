            "There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker,
            or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself."<br/>

        <p>Our coaches have been part of many success stories, including medals at cadet, junior, and veteran world championships. We have quite a few national titles and medalists as well.  Our athletes have gone on to some of the most prestigious universities in the nation, such as Harvard, Columbia, NYU, Emory, and many more. </p>



        <p>The real success story is not a medal or a title, but rather written with the mastery of oneâ€™s movements and emotions - going farther than one might have, otherwise. We look forward to joining you on this journey.</p>
