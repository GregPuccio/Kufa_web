        <h4>MONTHLY CLASS SUBSCRIPTIONS</h4>

        <p>Monthly class packages <b>for members</b> offer discounts to the above. <b>NON-MEMBERS</b> may purchase
            classes individually and be billed monthly, but free bouting charges will apply during sessions outside
            of the class. An Unlimited package represents the best value for serious athletes, saving $220 per month
            from the member rate above if four total classes and one footwork/fitness are taken per week.</p>

    <div class="section-title">PRIVATE LESSON FEES</div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>PRIVATE LESSONS</h4>
        <p>Private lessons with any coach are 20 or 40 minutes in length and instruct students specifically and
            individually about technique, balance, tactical progressions, rhythm, and coordination. While classes are
            designed to create proficient fencers, private lessons are a way to gain a deeper understanding of fine
            points that can make a proficient athlete into a highly skilled one. They are an important part of a serious
            athleteâ€™s overall development.</p>

        <p>Lessons must generally be cancelled at least 24 hours in advance to avoid being charged, though reasonable
            exceptions to this policy may be made at the discretion of the coach. Please arrive for your lesson at least
            10 minutes before start time to ensure a proper warm up and a complete experience.</p>
